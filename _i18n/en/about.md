Virtuagora is an open-source web plataform for citizen participation, made with open tools and languages, easy installation on xAMP servers.

The new version of Virtu√°gora focuses on small municipalities, communes and civil society organizations, with the aim of providing a digital tool accessible from the cloud that allows them to manage and publish their own citizen participation initiatives in a easy, personalized, customizable way, without the need of technical knowledge or complex implementations.

Oriented in this approach, the project aims to expand the current functionalities and create new ones, improving the platform with multiple options for customization, making them arise from a collaborative and participatory hacking, using the platform as a base and generating a brainstorm with previous experiences of other platforms, the current needs of the organizations and institutions interested in its use and, as well as, the citizens themselves.
